### Overview

This project was our results for the Winter Hackathon Umass challenge in 2021. The product is a quick, single-tap website which allows users in an emergency to search for the hospitals nearest to them, along with the hospital's website, rating, and travel direction. 

Special thanks to my friends Bryan, Amad, and Amin for contributing. 

### How to run

1. Clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/Slayzur02/Hospital-Locator`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the project: `npm run dev`

### Tech stack

Our original direction for the applicatino was based on the categorical prizes during the event. For this, one particularly stood out, which was the prize for `Radar.io`, which seemed to be a cool alternative to google maps. It was fitted with amazing documentation, and was niche enough - so we were confident that not many other teams were going to compete in this category. 

The product itself uses svelte: https://svelte.dev/. This was our choice for organizing the frontend to the team, since many of our members were only familiar with certain CRUD concepts, and not any particular framework. With a strong, extensive documentation system (and great tutorial), we figured this was a simple way to organize our project and get on track.
